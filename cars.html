                      <dd>It's a very special model that can cost up to $5M.
                        This fancy car was made in 1957, and it's a super rare because
                        only about 200 models were ever created.
                        The famous racecar driver John Surtees used to own one of these cars. It's so expensive because there aren't many like it, and people really want rare things!
                        The 507 has a classic design that looks amazing even today, making it a dream come true for someone who loves cars. If you're lucky enough to see one of these, you're looking at one of the most expensive BMW cars ever!

                      <dd> It's an amazing car that can cost around $3M. this unique supercar
                        was shown to the world in 1991, and it has a cool design created
                        by Giorgetto Giugiaro, a famous designer.
                      It was built in Italy and has powerful 5.0L V12 engine made even stronger by Alpina, which helps it reach up to 350 horsepower! The Nazca M12 is very fast too beacuse it can go nearly 200 mph.
                      Sadly, only three oh these fantastic cars were ever made, making them really hard to find. So if you ever come across the BMW Nazca M12, you'll know it's one of the priciest BMWs out there!

                      <dd> It's a classic car that can be worth up to $3M. This stylish roadster
                        was made after World War 2 when the company needed to show it could
                        still make amazing cars.
                        It was created in 1956 and had an all-alluminum V8 engine with 3.2 liters, which could produce 150 horsepower. However, because it cost almost as much as a Mercedes-Benz 300 SL but wasn't as fast or good-looking, not many people bought it.
                        only about 252 of these cars were sold before they stopped making them in 1959. That's why the BMW 507 is so rare and expensive today!

                        could provide up to 80 horsepower.
                        This might not seem like much now, but back then,it was perfect for racing! In fact,the BMW 328 won lots of races all over the world during its time,including the big Mille Miglia race in 1940. People kept using this car for racing untill 1951 because it was so good and reliable. Today, the BMW328 is seen as an important part of history and is one of the most expensive vintage BMW cars out there!

                        to help BMW win in IMSA racing events. However,it's powerful V8
                        engine broke some rules, and that caused quite a stir! To fix the issue, BMW decided to make a vision of this car for people to drive on regular roads too. There are only 10 M3 GTRs believed to me made, but we know for sure that at leat 4 exist and are held by BMW themselves. Some people think 6 more were sold to secret collectors, but no one knows for sure. Either way, the rare and exciting BMW M3 E46 GTR V8 is one pricey ride!
